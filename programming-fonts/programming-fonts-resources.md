*Iconic font aggregator, collection, and patcher*

Specifically to add a high number of extra glyphs from popular ‘iconic fonts’ such as [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome), [Devicons](https://vorillaz.github.io/devicons/#/main), [Octicons](https://github.com/primer/octicons), and others.
